# Web-Design-Challenge

In this web design assignment, I created a visualization dash board that explains the provided project with explanatory notes and visualizations. 
I crated a landing page as the main page where we can see a comparison of all the plots. I also created other individual pages where we can view the data used for the plots. This individual pages contain visualizations with their corresponding explanations. Moreover, each individual pages are linked with each other and we can navigate between them. 
At the top of all the websites, I have created a navigation menu with the site's name on the left that allows users to return to the landing page from any page. On the right side, the navigation bar contains a dropdown menu and two more text links that link to their corresponding pages. The dropdown menu links to each visualization page, and the text links to the comparison and data pages.
